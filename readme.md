🚀 **Chessli v2 is on the Horizon!** 🚀

Incredibly, despite my prolonged absence, I continue to receive heartfelt 💌 *thank you notes* and eager requests for this tool. This overwhelming support has inspired me to develop a sleek new version of Chessli that not only squashes all those pesky bugs 🐛 but also introduces a user-friendly graphical interface. This means **no programming experience** is required to dive in!

~~I'm aiming to wrap up this exciting update in the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned for an announcement 📢 right here as soon as it's ready to launch. 😊~~

📢📢 Update: Chessli2 is up-and-running! Head over to https://github.com/pwenker/chessli2/ and try it out! 📢📢

- **Find your mistakes** by parsing your games and analysing them with [`python-chess`](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).
- **Build a simple opening repertoire and list your known openings**
- **Spaced repetition & Retrieval Practice**: Automatically (via [`apy`](https://github.com/lervag/apy)) or manually (via csv export) add your game mistakes, your openings and your tackled lichess puzzles into [`Anki`](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- **Stats and visualizations**: Seamlessly show `lichess leaderboards` or plot your `rating history`.
